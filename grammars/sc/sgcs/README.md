# Scope Graph Concrete Syntax

Here may be a place for the concrete syntax for scope graphs.

This uses the scope graph library in much the same way that another
programming langauge would: it builds scope graphs and asks for
resolutions.

Different scope graph representations may `aspect` the productions in
the concrete syntax in order to construct their scope graph
representations.
